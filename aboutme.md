my name is Dinesh Gajjar.

### As a human being –
I’m a programmer, a regular reader, occasional blogger, and eager learner.
Sometimes I lead others, sometimes I led by others, mostly I work in the team.
I love to travel with family & friends, I am passionate about world movies and prefer listening songs at times.
Sometimes I go for trekking, occasionally prefer to capture the candid moments in camera.
At times, I like to be alone, sometimes I prefer to be with nature, but always love to be with loved ones, no matter wherever we are.

### Being engineer
In the field of software engineering, over period of decade –
I got the chance to meet seasoned engineers and awesome designers, tough task masters and people managers,  excellent teachers and leaders with great insight.  Interaction with those souls helped me to grow professionally and personally.
I have got an opportunity to write in languages that have executed on iPhone, Windows, PDAs and Micro-Controllers, by applying some “solid” and fundamental principles; used well-known repositories to keep the code safe, all by practicing popular processes of software development.

### Reader
There are many books, articles, fables, poems and other writings in the world at present that if we keep reading every day, even then spending entire life will not be enough.
But from all those writings, there are some which stand out clearly and have proved deep impact on individuals, thinking, belief, living, society, nation, and shown power to create the history, provoked, led to revolution. If you don’t believe,  look at the example from very recent history – “Uncle tom’s cabin“. This book ignited the revolt which changed the life of generation to come.
