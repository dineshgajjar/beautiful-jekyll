my name is Dinesh Gajjar.

I’m a programmer, a regular reader, occasional blogger, and eager learner.

Sometimes I lead others, sometimes I led by others, mostly I work in the team.

I love to travel with family & friends, I am passionate about world movies and prefer listening songs at times.
Sometimes I go for trekking, occasionally prefer to capture the candid moments in camera.

At times, I like to be alone, sometimes I prefer to be with nature, but always love to be with loved ones, no matter wherever we are.
